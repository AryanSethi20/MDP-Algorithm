# MDP Group 1 Algorithm

#### Demo 1: Simulate a Hybrid A* path
- Red square: Obstacle & image (dark red flap)
- Red dot: Robot's btm left corner
- Circles: Turning arcs
- Dotted rectangles: Desired final position of robot at each obstacle

Here, we simulate the path found using hybrid A* from source (0,0), to one of the obstacles at (120, 30)
