# MDP Group 1 (RANK 1 out of 44)

Build a robotic system that can
- Autonomously explore/traverse a known area, detecting images displayed on the arena
- Obstacle avoidance by using visual markers “bulls eye”
- Transmit and receive control signals from mobile device
- Simulate physical robot and algorithms in software

<hr>

## Algorithm tasks to solve:
- How to represent the navigational area, the robot, the obstacles and images
- How to find a (shortest/fastest) Hamiltonian path from START point

<hr>

## Actual Task 1 Demo:

- Runtime: 52 seconds
- Beats the next best opponent by 16 seconds

## Task-1 Grid Simulation:
- Red square: Obstacle & image (dark red flap)
- Red dot: Robot's bottom left corner
